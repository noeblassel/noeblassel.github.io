# Academic Status

I am a PhD student in Mathematics at the [CERMICS](https://cermics-lab.enpc.fr/) lab, and am a part of the [MATHERIALS](https://www.inria.fr/en/matherials) INRIA research project. My [PhD project](https://www.theses.fr/en/s343177) revolves around the analysis of algorithms designed to accelerate the sampling of 
rare events, such as the transitions between [metastable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastability) configurational states in molecular systems typically encountered in biology or condensed matter physics. This PhD is funded by the [EMC2](https://erc-emc2.eu/) ERC Synergy grant, and my advisors are [Tony Lelievre](https://cermics.enpc.fr/~lelievre/) and [Gabriel Stoltz](https://cermics-lab.enpc.fr/gabriel-stoltz/).

# Resume

Previously, I completed a [MSc / M2](https://www.lpsm.paris/masters/modale/index) in Stochastic Processes, at Sorbonne Université in Paris. My thesis, _Probabilités non-commutatives et entropie libre_, can be found [here](/memoire_probas.pdf) (in French).

I then completed a [MSc / M2](https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr/MathModel/index_en.html) in Numerical analysis and PDEs, also at Sorbonne Université. My research internship, _(Non)-equilibrium molecular dynamics and a Norton method for the estimation of transport coefficients_, took place at CERMICS with Gabriel Stoltz, and the resulting report can be found [here](/rapport_stage.pdf).

A PDF version can be found [here](/cv.pdf).

# Broader Interests

I am scientifically interested in the field of computational statistical physics and the interface between probability and PDE analysis. 
For numerical applications, I enjoy working with the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) programming language, but I am also proficient in C/C++ and Python.
