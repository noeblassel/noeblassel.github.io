I am a PhD student in Mathematics at the [CERMICS](https://cermics-lab.enpc.fr/) lab, and am a part of the [MATHERIALS](https://www.inria.fr/en/matherials) INRIA research project. My [PhD project](https://www.theses.fr/en/s343177) revolves around the numerical analysis of algorithms designed to accelerate the sampling of transitions from one [metastable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metastability) configurational domain to another, in molecular systems such as those typically encountered in biology. This PhD is funded by the [EMC2](https://erc-emc2.eu/) ERC Synergy grant, and my advisors are [Tony Lelièvre](https://cermics.enpc.fr/~lelievre/) and [Gabriel Stoltz](https://cermics-lab.enpc.fr/gabriel-stoltz/).
 
Previously, I completed a [MSc](https://www.lpsm.paris/masters/modale/index) in Stochastic Processes, at Sorbonne Université in Paris. My Thesis, _Probabilités non-commutatives et entropie libre_, can be found [here](/memoire_probas.pdf) (in French).

I then completed a [MSc](https://www.ljll.math.upmc.fr/MathModel/index_en.html) in Numerical analysis, also at Sorbonne Université. My research internship, _(Non)-equilibrium molecular dynamics and a Norton method for the estimation of transport coefficients_, took place at CERMICS, and the resulting report can be found [here](/rapport_stage.pdf).
