# Probability
I taught a course on Probability to a group of first year students at École des Ponts (third year undergraduates), from November 2022-January 2023. A description of the course can be found [here](http://gede.enpc.fr/programme/fiche.aspx?param=M%3a1PROB). Course material can be found on Aurélien Alfonsi's homepage [here](http://cermics.enpc.fr/~alfonsi/Proba1A.html), and here is a [Jupyter notebook](/tp_simu.ipynb) about sampling techniques for common types of random variables.
