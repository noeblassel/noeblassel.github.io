## At the undergraduate level

### Probability Theory (Winter 2022, Winter 2023, Winter 2024), 75h total
Lectures and exercice sessions in Probability theory.
First-year course at École des Ponts ParisTech (third year undergraduates). A description of the course can be found [here](http://gede.enpc.fr/programme/fiche.aspx?param=M%3a1PROB). Course material can be found on Aurélien Alfonsi's homepage [here](http://cermics.enpc.fr/~alfonsi/Proba1A.html), [here]() is a Jupyter notebook about sampling techniques for common types of random variables, and [here](../teaching/tp_mc.ipynb) is a Jupyter notebook about the Monte-Carlo method.
Here are a few problem sets I wrote and assigned, with solutions (in French): [P1](../teaching/DM1.pdf),[P2](../teaching/DM2.pdf),[P3](../teaching/DM3.pdf).

### Practical Scientific Computing (Spring 2023, Spring 2024), 36h total
Lectures and practical sessions in numerical analysis and scientific computing using Julia.
First-year course at École des Ponts. The course material can be found [here](https://jfbarthelemy.github.io/Cours_ENPC_pratique_calcul_scientifique/) (slides, notes and Jupyter notebooks in Julia).

### Mathematics in action (Fall 2023), 12h total
Practical sessions in mathematics and scientific computing using Python.
First-year warm-up classes at École des Ponts. Course material can be found on a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/GabrielStoltz/MACT).

### Project supervision (Fall-Winter 2023), 15h total
Paris Applied Mathematics Semester (PAMS) project of Alfonso Mateos Vicente at École des Ponts ParisTech, titled **Integrative approaches to simulating random variables, Hamiltonian dynamics and Markov chains**. The resulting code and report are available on a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/AlffonsoMV/PAMSProject).

## At the PhD / research level

### Molly workshop on DPD (Fall 2022)
Workshop on implementing new methods in [Molly.jl](https://github.com/JuliaMolSim/Molly.jl). Code is available in a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/noeblassel/Molly_DPD_workshop).

### SINEQ Summer school (Summer 2023)
Hands-on session on accelerated molecular dynamics at the [SINEQ summer school 2023](https://sites.google.com/view/aleiac/anr-sineq/summer-school-mol-dyn-on-julia). Code for hands-on sessions is available on a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/noeblassel/SINEQSummerSchool2023).
