[{"content":"I am a PhD student in Mathematics at the CERMICS lab, and am a part of the MATHERIALS INRIA research project. My PhD project revolves around the numerical analysis of algorithms designed to accelerate the sampling of transitions from one metastable configurational domain to another, in molecular systems such as those typically encountered in biology. This PhD is funded by the EMC2 ERC Synergy grant, and my advisors are Tony Lelièvre and Gabriel Stoltz.\nPreviously, I completed a MSc in Stochastic Processes, at Sorbonne Université in Paris. My Thesis, Probabilités non-commutatives et entropie libre, can be found here (in French).\nI then completed a MSc in Numerical analysis, also at Sorbonne Université. My research internship, (Non)-equilibrium molecular dynamics and a Norton method for the estimation of transport coefficients, took place at CERMICS, and the resulting report can be found here.\nA more comprehensive resume can be found here.\n","permalink":"https://noeblassel.github.io/about/","summary":"I am a PhD student in Mathematics at the CERMICS lab, and am a part of the MATHERIALS INRIA research project.
